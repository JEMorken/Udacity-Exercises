# Udacity-Exercises
Diamonds Projects for Springboard Class

The sets of files within this project are my answers to the 3 Udacity problem sets on the Diamonds data set.  
I had already named the first file before realizing there would be 3 problem sets, but sets 2 and 3 will have the appropriate number at the end of the file name.

Springboard only requested the Diamonds related work; however, there are some additional practice sets within the problem set.  These will appear as separate files.
